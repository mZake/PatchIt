# PatchIt
PatchIt is a tool designed to apply and read patch files commonly used in the ROM hacking community.

# Planned Features
PatchIt is planned to provide full support for `.ips`, `.ups` and `.bps` formats, meaning you'll be able to read, apply and create patchs in these formats. Support for more formats may be added in the future!
